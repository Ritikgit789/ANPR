Automatic number plate recognition using OpenCV and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) ----

{Image processing plays a key role in number plate recognition projects. Techniques like edge detection and contour analysis help identify the plate's boundaries, while image filtering enhances clarity for accurate recognition. OpenCV is widely used for tasks such as segmenting characters from plates and preprocessing images for OCR. These methods ensure efficient and reliable extraction of number plate details, even in varying lighting or environmental conditions.}
